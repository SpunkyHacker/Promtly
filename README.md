3. *HTML5 + CSS3* ‚Äì For the popup UI and options page.

### UI / Styling
1. CSS ‚Äì For a modern, responsive popup design.

### AI Optimization Logic
1. Local Hosted Ai (Right-Now) ‚Äì Right Now using llama3.1:8b hosted locally
2. External AI API (optional) ‚Äì Working on to use more lighter and fine tuned ai which is hosted on a server.

Instead of wasting time rewriting prompts, *Promtly* makes your ideas sharper and more effective instantly.  
It reduces the use of using Heavy Ai carelessly.
